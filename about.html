<div class="Jitendra-Sharma">
    <div class="Jitendra-Sharma-para">
    <div class="jitendra">After completing school education, students find themselves at crossroads in the world of careers and look for a good career with a good institute. They not only have to choose a career / stream, but also have to select the right college that helps them in shaping their career. ShriRam Group of Colleges, comprising of three colleges i.e. ShriRam College of Engineering & Management (SRCEM), ShriRam Institute of Information Technology (SRIIT) and ShriRam College of Pharmacy (SRCP) today stands on the top pedestal in terms of merit and credibility. In a short span of sixteen years, it has made rapid strides and has carved a niche amongst leading and reputed technical institutions not only at state level but at the national level too. Teaching at all the three colleges of ShriRam Group of Colleges does not follow the rigidity of syllabus prescribed by the University, rather, it goes far beyond the curriculum and students are additionally given hands-on experience on state-of-the-art software tools being used by R&D departments of leading industries across the globe. I wish all students a successful and bright career after passing out from the colleges of the Group.</div>
